            <section>
                <p>
                    At the end of July, 2023, AquaPack Robotics represented
                    North Carolina State University at RoboSub 2023, held at
                    NIWC TRANSDEC in San Diego, California, USA. Across eight
                    days, the team worked on SeaWolf VIII, undertook five days
                    of competition testing, and completed two semi-finals runs.
                    With a year of hard work and countless hours spent preparing
                    for this competition, the team is proud to announce we
                    placed fourteenth overall at RoboSub 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scoring for the competition is broken up into multiple
                    parts, with design documentation, the team introductory
                    video, the team's website, a design presentation, and the
                    best competition run all being scored. Our scoring broke
                    down as follows:
                </p>
                <table>

                    The team would especially like to thank the Isabella
                    Mormando and the NC State Electrical and Computer
                    Engineering Department for their fantastic help in filiming
                    the team's introductory video for this year.

                    The points-scoring competition runs are split across a
                    maximum of four phases. Each team is given the opportunity
                    to qualify, two chances at a good semi-finals run, a
                    "third-chance" run for teams who competed in semi-finals but
                    did not make finals, and a finals run. Qualification
                    requires that a team must demonstrate autonomy by
                    successfully navigating through a "gate" without being
                    controlled by the team from the surface. In semi-finals,
                    teams are given the opportunity to complete various tasks,
                    such as firing torpedoes at a target, dropping markers in a
                    box, and identifying and touching a buoy. Each successfully
                    completed task rewards a certain number of points, with the
                    highest scoring teams then moving on to compete in the
                    finals. As previously mentioned, the "third chance" runs
                    allow for any team that qualified for semi-finals, but
                    didn't meet the points threshold for finals, to perform
                    additional points-scoring runs on finals day, with the aim
                    of scoring enough points to meet the threshold for a finals
                    run.

                    AquaPack completed runs in both alloted semi-finals slots,
                    and attempted a third chance run. [[During the second
                    semi-final run, the team achieved our highest scoring, with
                    a score of 1326 points.]] After semi-finals had completed,
                    the team was placed 13th in competition run scoring, before
                    being bumped to 14th place after an impressive effort by
                    Amador Valley High School, who scored well in their third
                    chance run following two days of robot repair during
                    semi-finals. Some of these repairs required new Blue
                    Robotics Electronics Speed Controllers, which AquaPack
                    gladly supplied to the team, ultimately enabling them to
                    finish fifth overall in competition runs.

                    The second semi-finals day saw the team's highest points
                    scoring autonomous run, surfacing with 1326 points. 15
                    additional points were gained as a weight bonus, as SeaWolf
                    VIII's total weight measured in at 34.6 kilograms before the
                    run.
